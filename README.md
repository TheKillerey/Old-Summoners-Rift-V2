# Old Summoners Rift V2 - Custom Skin Mod by TheKillerey

Welcome to the **Old Summoners Rift V2** custom skin mod! This mod brings back the nostalgia of the classic Summoner's Rift with enhanced features and updated visuals. Relive the old days with updated textures, particles, and sounds that give you the classic feel while maintaining modern-day performance.

## Features

- **Classic Map Textures**: Experience the old Summoner's Rift with all its classic textures, including jungle camps, Baron, Dragons, and minions.
- **Old Structures**: Enjoy the nostalgia of the old turrets, inhibitors, and Nexus, all brought back to life.
- **Old Particles & Effects**: Original particles and visual effects for a fully immersive experience.
- **Classic Background Sound Effects**: Classic ambient sounds that bring back memories.
- **Night Verion (Alpha)**: Changes the map into the night version
- **Long Time-Support**: I added a feature that allows me to avoid Riot's name changes and after update crashes.
